## Hydrology data analysis project

This project contains hydrology-related outputs from two versions of the dynamic vegetation model CAETÊ (CArbon and Ecosystem Trait-based Evaluation model) which I developed during my undergraduate studies.

## versions

The two versions analysed here are:

  IC-CAETE-DVM

    This version contains an updated hydrological module, with the implementation of an additional soil layer to the simulation, variable water retention capabilities derived from soil texture and a new runoff calculation system.

  PVM-CAETE-DVM

    This version contains the previous hydrological module used on CAETÊ, which is based on CPTEC-PVM model (reference).

The entire main version of the model is available at https://github.com/jpdarela/CAETE-DVM
